        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi <strong>Everyone!</strong> 👋🏻</p>
        <p>My name is <strong>Jackielyn Abangan</strong>, and welcome to my blog about my favorite hobby crocheting!</p>
        <p>Crocheting has truly changed the way I see creativity and patience. Every stitch feels like a small accomplishment, and watching my projects come to life gives me such a sense of fulfillment.</p>
        <p>It’s not always easy sometimes it takes hours just to finish a small piece but that’s part of what makes it so rewarding. With every mistake, I learn something new and improve my skills little by little.</p>
        <p>What I love most about crocheting is how it lets me express myself. Whether I’m making something for fun, for someone special, or to sell, each piece carries a bit of my effort, care, and love.</p>
        <p>For me, crochet isn’t just a hobby it’s a way to unwind, create, and connect with others who share the same passion.</p>

        <h2>My Thoughts About Crocheting</h2>
        <p>For me, crocheting is both fun and challenging. There are times when patterns don’t turn out the way I expect, but I’ve learned that it’s all part of the process.</p>
        <p>Crocheting has also become my stress reliever. It helps me relax after a long day and gives me sense of peace and purpose when things get overwhelming.</p>
        <p>I feel proud whenever I see someone using or wearing something I’ve made. It reminds me that even if I don’t always excel in school, I’m still capable of creating something beautiful and meaningful with my own hands.</p>
        <p>Crocheting has taught me patience, creativity, and confidence, and it will always be a special part of who I am.</p>

        <h2>What is Crochet?</h2>
        <p>Crochet is a type of needlecraft that uses a single hooked needle to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or other materials to make textiles.</p>
        <p>Unlike knitting, which keeps several stitches open at once, crocheting completes each stitch before starting the next. This creates different textures and patterns from soft, lacy designs to thick, cozy fabrics.</p>
        <p>Crocheters use different stitches, such as “sc” (single crochet) and “dc” (double crochet), to make many items like blankets, hats, scarves, bags, and even stuffed toys known as amigurumi.</p>
        <p>Aside from being a fun hobby, many people find crochet calming and a great way to relieve stress.</p>

        <h2>How Crochet Was Introduced to Me</h2>
        <p>My love for crochet began back in senior high school, around Grade 11 to 12. It was my Auntie Jen, my mom’s sister, who first introduced me to it.</p> 
        <p>One day, she asked my mom if I knew how to crochet. When she learned that I didn’t, she eagerly offered to teach me herself. She provided all the tools and materials I needed and patiently guided me through every step.</p>
        <p>She also encouraged me by saying that once I got better, I could even earn from the things I made. That simple moment of encouragement sparked my curiosity and eventually, my passion for crocheting began to grow.</p>

        <p>Today, she manages several bazaars around Davao City, where she sells her lovely handmade creations from keychains, hats, and hair clips to headbands and crochet bouquets.</p>
        <p>As her business continued to grow, she needed an extra hand to keep up with the demand. That’s when she decided to train me and welcome me as part of her team an opportunity that helped me fall even more in love with crochet.</p>

        <h2>Handmade Gifts from the Heart</h2>
        <p>Crocheting isn’t just a business for me it’s also a meaningful way to express love, care, and appreciation through something handmade.</p>
        <p>When I was in college, I made crochet gifts for my friends on Valentine’s Day to show how much I appreciated their friendship and support.</p>
        <div class="image-row">
